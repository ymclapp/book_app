/* State - a way to describe how our modules look in different dynamic situations. So this part is really for interactivity: We want different behavior if an element is considered to be hidden, expanded, or modified. States are applied to the same element as layout so we are adding an additional rule which will override previous ones, if any. The state rule is given precedence, as itâ€™s the last one in the chain of rules.  As with layout styles, we tend to use prefixes here. This helps us to recognize them and to give them priority. Here we use the is prefix, as in is-hidden or is-selected. */
